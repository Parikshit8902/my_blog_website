                I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. Currently, I'm in my pre-final year. I hail from the city of Vadodara, in the state of Gujarat. I'm a 20 year old, currently hustling between two towns of the state, aiming to make a difference! Being born in a Maharashtrian Family with a tinch of Gujarati culture to it, I got to inculcate the best of both worlds.

                Since childhood, Space and Computers have startled me. I look up high in the sky and wonder why! At the same time I look on my computer screen and wonder how! It is correctly said by Dr. Richard Feynman, "There is plenty of room at the bottom". Daring to add to this sentence, i would like to say that the top is equally empty too! And that is what drives me into curiosity.

                <br>
                I joined them for the duration of a month, as an Embedded Systems intern. Where I was assigned task to develop PCB for rehabilitation devices, along with working on Sensors to develop and test algorithms to track precise movements of the parts of the body.

                <h3>Embedded Systems have always pushed me to think beyond the box, for the box! Being a domain that combines the essence of both pure electronics and computer science, it shapes an individual's, especially an engineer's ethos to the best level. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The applications of Embedded Systems are vast! There is no domain in the Engineering ecosystem that doesn't involve the use of Systems. They provide a plethora of opportunities to work in the desired domain to an individual. Be it Aerospace, Defence or Space Technology, Embedded Systems find their way into every major industry.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Embedded Systems got me interested, as I am the type of person who wants to physically feel what I have created. When a car paasses by, or a satellite is successfully placed in orbit, or a jumbo-jet is flying by, an Embedded Systems Engineer could proudly say that that entity has his/her software running on it. I found it super cool, which fueled my passion for the domain. To fulfil it, I'm constantly looking for learning opportunities. I'm open to opportunities which would help me turn my knowledge into practical solutions and do justice to myself, the company as well as contribute towards development of the society.</h3>
